# GIF_Generator
My second python project ever. You need to install version 3 of imageio using pip installer. The images you want to convert into a GIF should be in the same directory as the project. The images should also be of the same width and height. If the project does not work, try meddling with the code as this is just one of my early projects.

Red Joker.jpg and Dead joker.jpg are just sample files that you can use if you do not have files that you might want to convert to gifs. Sample.gif is just a sample gif that I created by using my project. The sample is just to showcase that the code works. The code is set in such a way that each image lasts 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) and goes on in a neverending loop. To start the project you need to use "pip3 install imageio". In one part of the code I have typed in "import imageio.v3 as iio", this is done so it is easier for me to type down the code. If you do not want this you can change the 1st line and the 31st line of the code. Someday, I would like to make a version of this project with a user friendly GUI and personally I found this project very interesting.
